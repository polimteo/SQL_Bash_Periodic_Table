For this project, I successfully created a Bash script to retrieve information about chemical elements from a PostgreSQL periodic table database. 

The script operates within a virtual Linux environment using Gitpod, and it interacts with the database to query and display detailed data about elements, including their atomic numbers, symbols, names, and various properties.

Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

1. Database Creation: The SQL script includes commands to create the periodic_table database, set configurations, and define schema objects with detailed constraints.
   
2. Schema and Data Integrity: Includes comprehensive constraints to maintain data integrity, such as primary keys, unique constraints, and foreign key relationships.
   
3. Data Insertion: Demonstrates the use of INSERT statements to populate tables with sample data, illustrating practical application of SQL for data management.
